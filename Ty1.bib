	abstract = {BIACORE biosensors are useful for measuring reaction kinetics and calculating affinity constants for macromolecular interactions. However, one drawback with the flow system used in these instruments is that the standard injection procedures limit the amount of time available to collect association-phase data. This is especially problematic during equilibrium analysis of high affinity interactions. Using protein–DNA interactions as a model system, we demonstrate a simple method for overcoming this limitation. By placing the analyte directly into the running buffer we were able to deliver a continuous supply of protein to the sensor surfaces for greater than 12 h at a time. Complete equilibrium binding profiles were generated by changing the concentration of analyte and allowing the surface reactions to reequilibrate. Analyte concentrations were also decreased to demonstrate that the binding reactions were fully reversible. This method of analysis is a simple and convenient way of directly measuring equilibrium dissociation constants for very high affinity interactions.},

In the present study we reviewed the majors reasons for such deviations, and present results which suggest that the most common source of deviations from the pseudo-first-order kinetic approximation of BIAcore kinetic data is likely to be heterogeneity of the immobilized ligand sites. A simplified analysis of the adsorption stage of BIAcore data is presented in terms of the net observed pseudo-first-order rate constant, kobs, rather than in terms of the association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd. The analysis is then extended to the determination of the dissociation equilibrium constant for the interaction of ligand and ligate in the solution phase from sensorgrams reflecting competition between soluble and immobilized forms of ligand for ligate.},

	abstract = {The present article considers the influence of heterogeneity in a mobile analyte or in an immobilized ligand population on the surface binding kinetics and equilibrium isotherms. We describe strategies for solving the inverse problem of calculating two-dimensional distributions of rate and affinity constants from experimental data on surface binding kinetics, such as obtained from optical biosensors. Although the characterization of a heterogeneous population of analytes binding to uniform surface sites may be possible under suitable experimental conditions, computational difficulties currently limit this approach. In contrast, the case of uniform analytes binding to heterogeneous populations of surface sites is computationally feasible, and can be combined with Tikhonov-Phillips and maximum entropy regularization techniques that provide the simplest distribution that is consistent with the data. The properties of this ligand distribution analysis are explored with several experimental and simulated data sets. The resulting two-dimensional rate and affinity constant distributions can describe well experimental kinetic traces measured with optical biosensors. The use of kinetic surface binding data can give significantly higher resolution than affinity distributions from the binding isotherms alone. The shape and the level of detail of the calculated distributions depend on the experimental conditions, such as contact times and the concentration range of the analyte. Despite the flexibility introduced by considering surface site distributions, the impostor application of this model to surface binding data from transport limited binding processes or from analyte distributions can be identified by large residuals, if a sufficient range of analyte concentrations and contact times are used. The distribution analysis can provide a rational interpretation of complex experimental surface binding kinetics, and provides an analytical tool for probing the homogeneity of the populations of immobilized protein.},

	abstract = {Once a homogeneous ensemble of a protein ligand is taken from solution and immobilized to a surface, for many reasons the resulting ensemble of surface binding sites may be heterogeneous. For example, this can be due to the intrinsic surface roughness causing variations in the local microenvironment, non-uniform density distribution of polymeric linkers, or non-uniform chemical attachment producing different protein orientations and conformations. We have previously described a computational method for determining the distribution of affinity and rate constants of surface sites from the analysis of experimental surface binding data. It fully exploits the high signal/noise ratio and reproducibility provided by optical biosensor technology, such as surface plasmon resonance. Since the computational analysis is ill-conditioned, the previous approach used a regularization strategy assuming a priori all binding parameters to be equally likely, resulting in the broadest possible parameter distribution consistent with the experimental data. We have now extended this method in a Bayesian approach to incorporate the opposite assumption, i.e. that the surface sites a priori are expected to be uniform (as one would expect in free solution). This results in a distribution of binding parameters as close to monodispersity as possible, given the experimental data. Using several model protein systems immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran surface and probed with surface plasmon resonance, we show micro-heterogeneity of the surface sites, in addition to broad populations of significantly altered affinity. The distributions obtained are highly reproducible. Immobilization conditions and the total surface density of immobilized sites can have a substantial impact on the functional distribution of the binding sites.},

A sink method was used to prevent analyte from rebinding the ligand-coated Octet tips and enabled us to extract accurate kinetic rate constants, as judged by their close agreement with those determined by SPR. Although the Octet is not sensitive enough to detect the binding of small molecules directly, it can access their affinities indirectly via solution competition experiments. We conducted similar experiments on the SPR instruments to validate these measurements. The Octet is emerging as a versatile complement to other more sophisticated biosensors, and the ProteOn provides high-quality data near the sensitivity of Biacore but in a more multiplexed format. Our results provide a benchmark for assessing the performance of the above-mentioned sensors.},

The mAb capture density of less than 0.6 nm was found to be optimal to measure a wide range of binding affinities on Octet HTX biosensor. The titration kinetic and single cycle kinetic assays performed on Octet HTX generated reproducible binding kinetic parameters and correlated with the values measured on Biacore 4000 and MASS-1. Kinetic assays performed on 0.1 nm density mAb surfaces significantly reduced MTL and enabled characterization of picomolar affinity mAbs. Finally, kinetic analysis performed on 150 antibodies to 10 antigens with molecular weights ranging from 21kD to 105kD showed concordance between Octet HTX, Biacore 4000 and MASS-1 (R2 {\textgreater} 0.90).

	abstract = {Introduction
Many biological response curves commonly assume a sigmoidal shape that can be approximated well by means of the 4-parameter nonlinear logistic equation, also called the Hill equation. However, estimation of the Hill equation parameters requires access to commercial software or the ability to write computer code. Here we present two user-friendly and freely available computer programs to fit the Hill equation — a Solver-based Microsoft Excel template and a stand-alone GUI-based “point and click” program, called HEPB.
Methods
Both computer programs use the iterative method to estimate two of the Hill equation parameters (EC50 and the Hill slope), while constraining the values of the other two parameters (the minimum and maximum asymptotes of the response variable) to fit the Hill equation to the data. In addition, HEPB draws the prediction band at a user-defined confidence level, and determines the EC50 value for each of the limits of this band to give boundary values that help objectively delineate sensitive, normal and resistant responses to the drug being tested.
Results
Both programs were tested by analyzing twelve datasets that varied widely in data values, sample size and slope, and were found to yield estimates of the Hill equation parameters that were essentially identical to those provided by commercial software such as GraphPad Prism and nls, the statistical package in the programming language R.
Discussion
The Excel template provides a means to estimate the parameters of the Hill equation and plot the regression line in a familiar Microsoft Office environment. HEPB, in addition to providing the above results, also computes the prediction band for the data at a user-defined level of confidence, and determines objective cut-off values to distinguish among response types (sensitive, normal and resistant). Both programs are found to yield estimated values that are essentially the same as those from standard software such as GraphPad Prism and the R-based nls. Furthermore, HEPB also has the option to simulate 500 response values based on the range of values of the dose variable in the original data and the fit of the Hill equation to that data.},
